                <p>
                    The fundamental theory of radiation refers to the scientific understanding of the nature and behavior of radiation, which includes various forms of electromagnetic radiation and particle radiation. This theory is primarily based on principles and discoveries made in the fields of physics and quantum mechanics. It encompasses both classical physics and the quantum nature of radiation.
                    <br> <br>
                    Radiation refers to the process of energy being emitted and propagated through space in the form of electromagnetic waves. Electromagnetic radiation encompasses a broad range of frequencies, known as the electromagnetic spectrum, which includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays.
                    <br> <br>
                    Electromagnetic waves are a combination of electric and magnetic fields oscillating perpendicular to each other and perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. They do not require a medium to travel through, which means they can propagate through a vacuum as well as through various materials and substances.

                <p>
                    As per IEEE, Antenna (or "Antenna System"): An antenna is a transducer (device) designed to convert electrical signals into electromagnetic waves for transmission through space or to convert electromagnetic waves received from space into electrical signals for reception. Antennas are essential components in various wireless communication systems, such as radio, television, cellular networks, satellite communications, and radar.
                    <br> <br>
                    An antenna is a device designed to transmit or receive electromagnetic waves, particularly in the radio frequency (RF) and microwave regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. It plays a crucial role in wireless communication systems by converting electrical signals into electromagnetic waves for transmission or vice versa, capturing incoming electromagnetic waves and converting them back into electrical signals for reception.

                <p>
                    The Friis transmission formula, also known as the Friis free space equation, is a fundamental equation used to calculate the power received by an antenna (P<sub>r</sub>) at a certain distance (R) from a transmitting antenna when both antennas are operating in free space. The formula takes into account the transmit power (P<sub>t</sub>), the gains of the transmitting (G<sub>t</sub>) and receiving (G<sub>r</sub>) antennas, and the wavelength of the signal (λ).

                <h1>4. Antenna Radiation Mechanism</h1>
                <p>
                    The radiation mechanism of an antenna refers to how it emits electromagnetic waves (radiation) into free space when it is used as a transmitter or how it captures incoming electromagnetic waves from space when it is used as a receiver. The radiation of electromagnetic waves from an antenna is a result of the movement and acceleration of electric charges within the antenna structure.
                    <br> <br>
                    Regardless of the type of antenna, all of them use the same basic principle that radiation is produced by accelerated charge. The basic equation of radiation is expressed mathematically as:
                    <br> <br>
                    <div class="formula">
                        iL= Qv
                    </div>
                    where:
                    <br> <br>
                    -L = Length of current elements,
                    <br>
                    -i = Current changing with time in (Ampere/second),
                    <br>
                    -Q = Charge, and
                    <br>
                    -v = Time change of velocity which is equal to acceleration of the charge in m/s.

                    <p class="figure-description"><b>Fig. 1.4:</b> <i>Antenna Radiation Mechanism Communication Link</i></p>
                    <br>
                    The antenna mechanism is divided into following parts:
                    <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-4-1"><b>4.1. Oscillating Electric Current:</b> <br>
                        The radiation mechanism starts with an alternating electric current flowing through the conductive elements of the antenna. This current alternates direction periodically, typically at radio frequencies, creating a time-varying electric charge distribution along the antenna's length.
                    </div>
                    <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-4-2"><b>4.2. Electric Field Formation:</b> <br>
                        The oscillating electric current results in a time-varying electric field surrounding the antenna. As the current changes direction, the electric field strength at any given point in space around the antenna also changes. This varying electric field extends far beyond the antenna's physical structure.
                    </div>
                    <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-4-3"><b>4.3. Magnetic Field Generation:</b> <br>
                        According to Maxwell's equations, a time-varying electric field induces a time-varying magnetic field perpendicular to it. In the case of the antenna, the changing electric field generated by the oscillating current also gives rise to a time-varying magnetic field around the antenna.
                    </div>
                    <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-4-4"><b>4.4. Electromagnetic Wave Propagation:</b> <br>
                        The oscillating electric and magnetic fields are interrelated and self-sustaining, forming electromagnetic waves. These waves consist of synchronized oscillations of electric and magnetic fields perpendicular to each other and to the direction of wave propagation. The electromagnetic waves radiate outward from the antenna into space, carrying energy and information with them.
                    </div>
                    <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-4-5"><b>4.5. Polarization:</b> <br>
                        The polarization of the radiated electromagnetic wave is determined by the orientation of the electric field vector with respect to the Earth's surface. It can be linear, circular, or elliptical, depending on the antenna's geometry and design.
                    </div>
                    <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-4-6"><b>4.6. Antenna Geometry and Radiation Pattern:</b> <br>
                        The radiation pattern of an antenna is a graphical representation of how its radiated power is distributed in different directions. It depends on the antenna's physical dimensions and the current distribution along its length. Antennas with different shapes and sizes have distinct radiation patterns, such as omnidirectional (radiating equally in all directions) or directional (focusing radiation in specific directions).
                    </div>
                    <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-4-7"><b>4.7. Receiving Antenna:</b> <br>
                        When the antenna is used as a receiver, the incoming electromagnetic waves induce a time-varying voltage across the antenna's conductive elements. This varying voltage corresponds to the oscillating electric field of the incoming waves.
                    </div>
                    <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-4-8"><b>4.8. Signal Detection:</b> <br>
                        The induced voltage in the receiving antenna is then fed into the connected electrical circuit (receiver). The circuit processes and demodulates the received signal, extracting the original information (e.g., voice, data, or video) carried by the electromagnetic waves.

                    The reactive field region, also known as the near-field or reactive near-field region, is a region in the immediate vicinity of an antenna where the electromagnetic fields produced by the antenna exhibit reactive behavior. This region is characterized by a significant variation in the electric and magnetic fields' magnitude and phase as compared to the fields in the far-field region.

                    The near-field Fresnel region, also known as the Fresnel zone, is a region that lies between the reactive near-field region and the far-field region of an antenna. It is characterized by a complex interaction between the reactive and radiating fields. In this region, the electromagnetic fields do not exhibit a stable far-field pattern, but they have partially transitioned from the reactive near-field behavior to the far-field characteristics.

                <p>
                    There are various types of antennas, each designed for specific applications and operating frequencies. Here are some common types of antennas:
                </p>
                <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-6-1"><b>6.1. Dipole and Monopole Antennas:</b> <br>
                    A dipole antenna consists of two conductive elements, often straight rods or wires, that are oriented in opposite directions and separated by a specific distance. The length of a dipole antenna is typically a half-wavelength (λ/2) at the operating frequency.
                    <br> <br>
                    Dipole antennas have an omnidirectional radiation pattern in the plane perpendicular to the antenna's axis. They radiate equally in all horizontal directions, making them ideal for applications requiring coverage in a horizontal plane, such as radio and TV broadcasting.
                    <br> <br>
                    Dipole antennas are used in a wide range of applications, including radio communication, television broadcasting, wireless networks, and amateur radio.
                    <br> <br>

                    <br>
                    A monopole antenna is a variation of the dipole antenna and consists of a single conductive element, usually a vertical rod or wire, that is mounted above a ground plane. The length of a monopole antenna is typically a quarter-wavelength (λ/4) at the operating frequency.
                    <br> <br>
                    Monopole antennas have an omnidirectional radiation pattern in the horizontal plane, similar to dipole antennas. However, they are more directive in the vertical plane, making them suitable for applications requiring vertical coverage, such as portable devices and mobile communication.
                    <br> <br>
                    The ground plane is an essential part of the monopole antenna, serving as a virtual mirror to the radiating element and influencing its radiation pattern. Monopole antennas are often designed to be ground-plane dependent, meaning they require a specific ground plane size and shape to perform optimally.
                    <br> <br>
                    Monopole antennas are commonly used in applications where a compact and vertically oriented antenna is required, such as smartphones, wireless routers, and wireless communication systems.

                <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-6-2"><b>6.2. Log-Periodic Antenna:</b> <br>
                    A log-periodic antenna is a type of broadband antenna that is designed to operate over a wide range of frequencies. It is characterized by its periodic structure and logarithmic variation in the sizes of its elements. The unique design of a log-periodic antenna allows it to maintain relatively constant performance over a broad frequency range, making it suitable for applications that require wideband coverage.
                    <br> <br>
                    A log-periodic antenna consists of a series of dipole or other basic elements that repeat in a periodic manner. The lengths of these elements vary logarithmically with position along the antenna's axis, which gives the antenna its name.

                    <br>
                    Log-periodic antennas often exhibit directional characteristics, with their maximum radiation in one direction and reduced radiation in other directions. The directionality becomes more pronounced at higher frequencies.
                    <br> <br>
                    Log-periodic antennas are designed to cover a broad range of frequencies, typically several octaves or more. They are widely used in applications requiring frequency scanning or wideband communication, such as spectrum analyzers, frequency-hopping systems, and broadband communication systems.

                <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-6-3"><b>6.3. Yagi-Uda Antenna:</b> <br>
                    The Yagi-Uda antenna, often referred to simply as the Yagi antenna, is a highly directional antenna with a parasitic element design. It was invented by Japanese engineers Hidetsugu Yagi and Shintaro Uda in 1926. The Yagi-Uda antenna is widely used in various applications, including TV reception, radio communication, wireless networks, and point-to-point links.
                    <br> <br>

                    <p class="figure-description"><b>Fig. 1.8:</b> <i>Yagi-Uda Antenna</i></p>
                    <br>
                    The Yagi-Uda antenna consists of one or more driven elements (usually a dipole) and several parasitic elements (typically straight rods or wires) arranged in a linear array. The parasitic elements do not have a direct connection to the feedline; instead, they interact with the electromagnetic fields of the driven element and each other to create a directional radiation pattern.
                    <br> <br>
                    The Yagi-Uda antenna is highly directional, with most of its radiated power concentrated in a specific direction, known as the forward direction or main lobe. This directional characteristic is achieved by controlling the amplitude and phase of the currents in the parasitic elements relative to the driven element. The parasitic elements include director elements, which are shorter than the driven element and are positioned in front of it, and reflector elements, which are longer and placed behind the driven element. The directors focus the radiation in the forward direction, while the reflector enhances the antenna's directivity and suppresses radiation in the opposite direction.
                    <br> <br>
                    With moderate to high gain, the Yagi-Uda antennas are designed to operate effectively at a specific frequency or a narrow frequency range. However, their bandwidth can be extended through minor adjustments in element lengths and spacings.

                <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-6-4"><b>6.4. Helix/Helical Antenna:</b> <br>
                    A helix or helical antenna is a type of antenna with a three-dimensional, corkscrew-like shape. It is characterized by its coiled structure, which gives it several unique properties and makes it suitable for specific applications. Helical antennas are commonly used in satellite communication, GPS systems, and other applications that require circular polarization.
                    <br> <br>

                    <p class="figure-description"><b>Fig. 1.9:</b> <i>Helical Antenna</i></p>
                    <br>
                    The helix antenna consists of a wire or conductive element wound in a helical or spiral shape around a central axis. The helix can be either right-hand or left-hand, depending on the direction of the spiral. These antennas operate in the axial mode, meaning that the electromagnetic waves primarily propagate along the axis of the helix. The antenna's radiation pattern is typically directional, with a broad beam in the direction of the axis and reduced radiation in other directions.
                    <br> <br>
                    Helical antennas can achieve moderate to high gain and can be designed to operate over a wide range of frequencies. Their operating frequency is determined by factors such as the number of turns, the pitch (spacing between turns), and the diameter of the helix.  Helical antennas can be relatively compact compared to other high-gain antennas, making them suitable for applications with limited space.
                    <br> <br>
                    A helix antenna can support different radiation modes or patterns, depending on its design and operating conditions. The two primary radiation modes of a helix antenna are:
                    <br> <br>
                    <b>Normal Mode:</b>
                    <br>
                    In the normal or end-fire mode, the helix antenna radiates most of its energy along the axis of the helix, creating a directional radiation pattern with the maximum radiation in the direction of the helix axis. This mode is often preferred for applications where high directivity and a focused beam are required.
                    <br> <br>
                    <b>Axial Mode:</b>
                    <br>
                    In the axial mode or broadside mode, the helix antenna radiates its energy perpendicular to the helix axis, creating a bidirectional radiation pattern with radiation equally distributed in two opposite directions perpendicular to the axis. This mode is also known as broadside because the antenna radiates broadside to the helix.

                    <br>
                    A slot antenna consists of a narrow and elongated opening (slot) on a conducting surface. The slot can be of various shapes, such as rectangular, circular, or elliptical, depending on the specific application and design requirements.  Slot antennas operate similarly to dipole antennas but with a different physical layout. The slot acts as a resonant element, and the electromagnetic waves are radiated or received through the slot opening.
                    <br> <br>
                    The radiation pattern of a slot antenna depends on the slot's dimensions and the size of the conducting surface. By carefully designing the slot and the surrounding structure, slot antennas can exhibit directional radiation patterns, making them suitable for applications that require focused radiation in specific directions.
                    <br> <br>
                    Slot antennas can be designed to operate over a wide frequency range, making them suitable for broadband applications. Slot antennas have various advantages, such as their planar configuration, ease of fabrication, and wideband capability. They are commonly used in mobile communication devices, Wi-Fi routers, satellite communication systems, and radar systems. In some cases, arrays of slot antennas are used to achieve higher directivity and gain for specific applications.

                    A parabolic reflector antenna, also known as a parabolic dish antenna, is a type of highly directional antenna that uses a parabolic-shaped reflector to focus and direct electromagnetic waves. It is widely used in long-range communication, satellite communication, radar systems, and radio astronomy due to its high gain and narrow beamwidth.
                    <br> <br>
                    The main component of the antenna is the parabolic reflector, which is a curved surface shaped like a paraboloid of revolution. The reflector is typically made of metal or other conductive materials. The shape of the parabolic reflector allows it to reflect and concentrate incoming or outgoing electromagnetic waves at the focal point.

                    Parabolic reflector antennas have a highly directional radiation pattern with a narrow beamwidth. The beamwidth depends on the size of the reflector and the operating frequency. The larger the reflector, the narrower the beamwidth and the higher the antenna gain.
                    <br> <br>
                    Since parabolic reflector antennas have a highly directional beam, precise alignment and pointing are essential for effective communication. Mechanical systems or motorized mounts are often used to track the target or the satellite for continuous communication.

                    A horn antenna is a type of microwave antenna characterized by its pyramidal or conical shape, which resembles a horn. It is widely used for high-frequency applications, particularly in microwave and radar systems, due to its ability to efficiently radiate and receive electromagnetic waves over a wide frequency range.
                    <br> <br>
                    A horn antenna is a metallic waveguide structure that tapers gradually from a wide opening (mouth) to a narrower section (throat). The mouth is the larger end of the horn, and the throat is the smaller end. The transition from the mouth to the throat is usually smooth to minimize reflections and losses.
                    <br> <br>
                    The horn shape allows for efficient coupling of electromagnetic waves between free space and the waveguide structure. It efficiently converts the electromagnetic energy from the waveguide into radiated waves in the surrounding space. Horn antennas can achieve high directivity, which means they focus the radiated energy into a narrow beam. The directivity depends on the horn's size and the frequency of operation.
                    <br> <br>

                    <br> <br>
                    <b>1. Main Lobe:</b>
                    <br>
                    The main lobe is the region of the radiation pattern where the antenna radiates maximum power. It corresponds to the direction in which the antenna is most sensitive or most directive. The width of the main lobe is measured as the beamwidth, which is the angular distance between two points on the pattern where the power drops to a specified fraction of the maximum (e.g., half-power or -3 dB points).
                    <br> <br>
                    <b>2. Back Lobe:</b>
                    <br>
                    The backlobe refers to the region directly opposite the main lobe. It represents the power radiated in the backward direction. A well-designed antenna typically has low radiation in the backlobe to minimize interference from signals coming from behind the antenna.
                    <br> <br>
                    <b>3. Side Lobes</b>
                    <br>
                    Side lobes are smaller lobes in the radiation pattern that appear around the main lobe. These lobes represent directions in which the antenna also radiates power but with less intensity than the main lobe. Side lobes can be desirable or undesirable, depending on the application. In some cases, minimizing side lobes is crucial to reduce interference with other systems.
                    <br> <br>
                    <b>4. Minor Lobes: </b>
                    <br>
                    Minor lobes are additional lobes that appear in an antenna's radiation pattern alongside the main lobe. They represent directions where the antenna radiates power with lower intensity compared to the main lobe. These radiations should be minimized.
                    <br> <br>
                    <b>Front to Back Ratio:</b>
                    <br>
                    The front-to-back ratio (F/B ratio) is the ratio of the maximum power radiated in the main lobe (forward direction) to the power radiated in the backlobe (backward direction). A high F/B ratio indicates good directionality and less sensitivity to signals coming from the back.
                </div>
                <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-7-2"><b>7.2. Beamwidth:</b> <br>
                    The beamwidth is the angular separation between two points on the radiation pattern where the power drops to half its maximum value. Typically, these points are measured on either side of the main lobe's peak, where the radiation intensity is at its highest.
                    <br> <br>
                    Half-Power Beamwidth is the angular width of the main lobe in an antenna's radiation pattern, measured between two points where the power has dropped to half (-3 dB) of the maximum radiated power. In other words, it represents the angle over which the radiated power is at least half of the maximum power in the main lobe. A narrower HPBW indicates a more focused and directive antenna with concentrated power in a specific direction, while a wider HPBW indicates a more omnidirectional or broader coverage pattern.
                    <br> <br>
                    First-Null Beamwidth is the angular width between the first nulls (zeroes) on either side of the main lobe in an antenna's radiation pattern. It represents the angle over which the power in the radiation pattern drops to zero or very close to zero. The FNBW provides information about the antenna's ability to reject signals from certain directions. A smaller FNBW indicates better angular selectivity and more significant rejection of unwanted signals, while a larger FNBW implies less angular selectivity.
                </div>
                <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-7-3"><b>7.3. Directivity:</b> <br>
                    Antenna directivity is a measure of how well an antenna focuses its radiated energy in a specific direction. It quantifies the ability of an antenna to concentrate its power in a particular direction while reducing radiation in other directions. Directivity is an essential characteristic for directional antennas used in various applications, including long-range communication, point-to-point links, and radar systems.
                    <br> <br>
                    Directivity is typically expressed as a dimensionless quantity in decibels (dBi) or as a ratio. It is often compared to the performance of an ideal isotropic radiator, which radiates power equally in all directions. An isotropic radiator has a directivity of 0 dBi.
                </div>
                <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-7-4"><b>7.4. Bandwidth:</b> <br>
                    Antenna bandwidth refers to the range of frequencies over which the antenna can operate effectively to transmit or receive electromagnetic signals. It is an important performance parameter that characterizes an antenna's ability to handle a range of frequencies without significant degradation in performance.
                    <br> <br>
                    In practical terms, the antenna's bandwidth is usually defined by the frequency range over which certain key performance parameters meet specific criteria.
                    <br> <br>
                    For antennas used in communication systems, a broader bandwidth is generally preferred, as it allows the antenna to handle a wider range of frequencies and support various communication channels.
                </div>
                <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-7-5"><b>7.5. Polarization:</b> <br>
                    Antenna polarization refers to the orientation of the electric field vector in an electromagnetic wave radiated or received by an antenna. It is a critical characteristic that defines the spatial orientation of the electromagnetic wave as it propagates through space.
                    <br> <br>
                    The electric field vector of an electromagnetic wave can oscillate in any direction perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. The most common types of antenna polarization are:
                    <br> <br>
                    <b>1. Linear Polarization:</b>
                    <br>
                    In linear polarization, the electric field vector oscillates in a straight line, either horizontally (parallel to the Earth's surface) or vertically (perpendicular to the Earth's surface). Linear polarization can be either horizontal polarization (HP) or vertical polarization (VP), depending on the orientation of the electric field vector.
                    <br> <br>
                    <b>2. Circlar Polarization:</b>
                    <br>
                    In circular polarization, the electric field vector traces out a circular pattern as the wave propagates. Circular polarization can be right-hand circular polarization (RHCP) or left-hand circular polarization (LHCP), depending on the direction of rotation of the electric field vector.
                    <br> <br>
                    <b>3. Elliptical Polarization:</b>
                    <br>
                    Elliptical polarization is a combination of linear and circular polarization, resulting in an elliptical pattern for the electric field vector.
                </div>
                <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-7-6"><b>7.6. Gain:</b> <br>
                    Antenna gain is a measure of how well an antenna can direct or concentrate its radiated power in a specific direction compared to an ideal isotropic radiator. It quantifies the ability of an antenna to radiate more power in a particular direction, thus increasing its effective range in that direction.
                </div>
                <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-7-7"><b>7.7. Input Impedence:</b> <br>
                    Input impedance is a critical parameter that characterizes the electrical properties of an antenna or any other electronic device that interacts with a transmission line or circuit. It refers to the complex impedance presented at the input terminals of the device when it is connected to an external source or load.
                    <br> <br>
                    For an antenna, the input impedance varies with frequency, polarization, and other factors. It is essential for the antenna to be well-matched to the transmission line or receiver it is connected to. A good impedance match ensures efficient power transfer and minimizes signal reflections and losses.
                </div>
                <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-7-8"><b>7.8. Radiation Resistance:</b> <br>
                    Radiation resistance, also known as radiation impedance, is a crucial concept in antenna theory and design. It is the equivalent resistance that represents the power radiated as electromagnetic waves from an antenna when it is transmitting a signal. In other words, radiation resistance quantifies the fraction of the input power that an antenna effectively radiates into space.
                </div>
                <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-7-9"><b>7.9. Efficiency:</b> <br>
                    Antenna efficiency is a measure of how effectively an antenna converts the input power into radiated electromagnetic waves. It quantifies the fraction of the input power that is radiated as useful electromagnetic energy, and it is a crucial parameter for evaluating an antenna's performance.
                    <br> <br>
                    Antenna efficiency is expressed as a percentage and is calculated as:
                    <br> <br>
                    Efficiency (%) = (Radiation Resistance / Total Input Impedance) x 100
                    <br> <br>
                    Antenna efficiency takes into account various losses that occur within the antenna system. Some of the key factors that can impact antenna efficiency include Ohmic losses due to various resistances, dielectric losses and reflection losses.
                    <br> <br>
                    An ideal antenna would have an efficiency of 100%, meaning that all the input power is radiated as electromagnetic waves with no losses. However, real-world antennas always have some losses, which reduce their efficiency.
                </div>
                <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-7-10"><b>7.10. Effective Length:</b> <br>
                    The effective antenna length refers to the length of an antenna as perceived by the radio waves it transmits or receives. It is not necessarily the same as the physical length of the antenna itself. Instead, it is a concept used to describe the effective electrical length of the antenna, which influences its resonant frequency and radiation pattern.
                    <br> <br>
                    The effective length of linearly polarized antenna receiving a plane wave in a given direction is defined as the ratio of the magnitude of the open circuit voltage developed at the terminals of the antenna tothe magnitude of the electric-field strength in the direction of the antenna polarization.
                </div>
                <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-7-11"><b>7.11. EFfective Area:</b> <br>
                    Antenna effective area, also known as aperture area or capture area, is a critical parameter that quantifies the ability of an antenna to capture electromagnetic energy from incoming signals. It represents the area of the antenna's aperture that is effective in capturing or intercepting the incident radiation.
                    <br> <br>
                    The effective area is directly related to the antenna's gain and is often used to compare antennas in terms of their receiving capabilities. A larger effective area generally indicates a more efficient antenna for receiving signals.
                </div>
                <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-7-12"><b>7.12. Radiation Intensity:</b> <br>
                    Radiation intensity is a measure of the power density of electromagnetic radiation radiated by an antenna in a specific direction. It quantifies the amount of power transmitted by the antenna in a given direction per unit solid angle. Radiation intensity is an important parameter in antenna theory and is used to analyze and characterize the directional properties of antennas.
