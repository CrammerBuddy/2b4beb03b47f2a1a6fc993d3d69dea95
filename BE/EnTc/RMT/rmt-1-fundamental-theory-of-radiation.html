                <p>
                    The fundamental theory of radiation refers to the scientific understanding of the nature and behavior of radiation, which includes various forms of electromagnetic radiation and particle radiation. This theory is primarily based on principles and discoveries made in the fields of physics and quantum mechanics. It encompasses both classical physics and the quantum nature of radiation.
                    <br> <br>
                    Radiation refers to the process of energy being emitted and propagated through space in the form of electromagnetic waves. Electromagnetic radiation encompasses a broad range of frequencies, known as the electromagnetic spectrum, which includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays.
                    <br> <br>
                    Electromagnetic waves are a combination of electric and magnetic fields oscillating perpendicular to each other and perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. They do not require a medium to travel through, which means they can propagate through a vacuum as well as through various materials and substances.

                <p>
                    As per IEEE, Antenna (or "Antenna System"): An antenna is a transducer (device) designed to convert electrical signals into electromagnetic waves for transmission through space or to convert electromagnetic waves received from space into electrical signals for reception. Antennas are essential components in various wireless communication systems, such as radio, television, cellular networks, satellite communications, and radar.
                    <br> <br>
                    An antenna is a device designed to transmit or receive electromagnetic waves, particularly in the radio frequency (RF) and microwave regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. It plays a crucial role in wireless communication systems by converting electrical signals into electromagnetic waves for transmission or vice versa, capturing incoming electromagnetic waves and converting them back into electrical signals for reception.

                <p>
                    The Friis transmission formula, also known as the Friis free space equation, is a fundamental equation used to calculate the power received by an antenna (P<sub>r</sub>) at a certain distance (R) from a transmitting antenna when both antennas are operating in free space. The formula takes into account the transmit power (P<sub>t</sub>), the gains of the transmitting (G<sub>t</sub>) and receiving (G<sub>r</sub>) antennas, and the wavelength of the signal (λ).

                <h1>4. Antenna Radiation Mechanism</h1>
                <p>
                    The radiation mechanism of an antenna refers to how it emits electromagnetic waves (radiation) into free space when it is used as a transmitter or how it captures incoming electromagnetic waves from space when it is used as a receiver. The radiation of electromagnetic waves from an antenna is a result of the movement and acceleration of electric charges within the antenna structure.
                    <br> <br>
                    Regardless of the type of antenna, all of them use the same basic principle that radiation is produced by accelerated charge. The basic equation of radiation is expressed mathematically as:
                    <br> <br>
                    <div class="formula">
                        iL= Qv
                    </div>
                    where:
                    <br> <br>
                    -L = Length of current elements,
                    <br>
                    -i = Current changing with time in (Ampere/second),
                    <br>
                    -Q = Charge, and
                    <br>
                    -v = Time change of velocity which is equal to acceleration of the charge in m/s.

                    <p class="figure-description"><b>Fig. 1.4:</b> <i>Antenna Radiation Mechanism Communication Link</i></p>
                    <br>
                    The antenna mechanism is divided into following parts:
                    <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-4-1"><b>4.1. Oscillating Electric Current:</b> <br>
                        The radiation mechanism starts with an alternating electric current flowing through the conductive elements of the antenna. This current alternates direction periodically, typically at radio frequencies, creating a time-varying electric charge distribution along the antenna's length.
                    </div>
                    <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-4-2"><b>4.2. Electric Field Formation:</b> <br>
                        The oscillating electric current results in a time-varying electric field surrounding the antenna. As the current changes direction, the electric field strength at any given point in space around the antenna also changes. This varying electric field extends far beyond the antenna's physical structure.
                    </div>
                    <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-4-3"><b>4.3. Magnetic Field Generation:</b> <br>
                        According to Maxwell's equations, a time-varying electric field induces a time-varying magnetic field perpendicular to it. In the case of the antenna, the changing electric field generated by the oscillating current also gives rise to a time-varying magnetic field around the antenna.
                    </div>
                    <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-4-4"><b>4.4. Electromagnetic Wave Propagation:</b> <br>
                        The oscillating electric and magnetic fields are interrelated and self-sustaining, forming electromagnetic waves. These waves consist of synchronized oscillations of electric and magnetic fields perpendicular to each other and to the direction of wave propagation. The electromagnetic waves radiate outward from the antenna into space, carrying energy and information with them.
                    </div>
                    <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-4-5"><b>4.5. Polarization:</b> <br>
                        The polarization of the radiated electromagnetic wave is determined by the orientation of the electric field vector with respect to the Earth's surface. It can be linear, circular, or elliptical, depending on the antenna's geometry and design.
                    </div>
                    <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-4-6"><b>4.6. Antenna Geometry and Radiation Pattern:</b> <br>
                        The radiation pattern of an antenna is a graphical representation of how its radiated power is distributed in different directions. It depends on the antenna's physical dimensions and the current distribution along its length. Antennas with different shapes and sizes have distinct radiation patterns, such as omnidirectional (radiating equally in all directions) or directional (focusing radiation in specific directions).
                    </div>
                    <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-4-7"><b>4.7. Receiving Antenna:</b> <br>
                        When the antenna is used as a receiver, the incoming electromagnetic waves induce a time-varying voltage across the antenna's conductive elements. This varying voltage corresponds to the oscillating electric field of the incoming waves.
                    </div>
                    <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-4-8"><b>4.8. Signal Detection:</b> <br>
                        The induced voltage in the receiving antenna is then fed into the connected electrical circuit (receiver). The circuit processes and demodulates the received signal, extracting the original information (e.g., voice, data, or video) carried by the electromagnetic waves.

                    The reactive field region, also known as the near-field or reactive near-field region, is a region in the immediate vicinity of an antenna where the electromagnetic fields produced by the antenna exhibit reactive behavior. This region is characterized by a significant variation in the electric and magnetic fields' magnitude and phase as compared to the fields in the far-field region.

                    The near-field Fresnel region, also known as the Fresnel zone, is a region that lies between the reactive near-field region and the far-field region of an antenna. It is characterized by a complex interaction between the reactive and radiating fields. In this region, the electromagnetic fields do not exhibit a stable far-field pattern, but they have partially transitioned from the reactive near-field behavior to the far-field characteristics.

                    Lobe formation starts in this region. The range of this region starts from the completion of reactive field region and extends upto:

                    The far-field Fraunhofer region, often simply referred to as the Fraunhofer region, is a specific part of the far-field region of an antenna. It is a well-defined region located at a distance from the antenna where the electromagnetic fields behave as if the waves are emanating from an infinitely distant point source. In this region, the electromagnetic waves resemble plane waves, and the radiation pattern becomes stable and independent of the distance.

                <h1>7. Antenna Performance Parameters</h1>
                <p>
                    Antenna performance parameters are key metrics used to evaluate the efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of an antenna's operation. These parameters help in characterizing how well an antenna performs its intended function and how effectively it can transmit or receive electromagnetic waves. Some of the important antenna performance parameters include:
                </p>
                <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-7-1"><b>7.1. Radiation Pattern:</b> <br>
                    The radiation pattern of an antenna describes the directional distribution of radiated power in space. It shows how the antenna's radiated energy is concentrated in different directions. Radiation patterns can be measured in both the azimuthal plane (horizontal plane) and the elevation plane (vertical plane).
                    <br> <br>

                    <br>
                    <p class="figure-description"><b>Fig. 1.5:</b> <i>Antenna Radiation Pattern</i></p>
                    <br>
                    Key points of a radiation pattern are:
                    <br> <br>
                    <b>1. Main Lobe:</b>
                    <br>
                    The main lobe is the region of the radiation pattern where the antenna radiates maximum power. It corresponds to the direction in which the antenna is most sensitive or most directive. The width of the main lobe is measured as the beamwidth, which is the angular distance between two points on the pattern where the power drops to a specified fraction of the maximum (e.g., half-power or -3 dB points).
                    <br> <br>
                    <b>2. Back Lobe:</b>
                    <br>
                    The backlobe refers to the region directly opposite the main lobe. It represents the power radiated in the backward direction. A well-designed antenna typically has low radiation in the backlobe to minimize interference from signals coming from behind the antenna.
                    <br> <br>
                    <b>3. Side Lobes</b>
                    <br>
                    Side lobes are smaller lobes in the radiation pattern that appear around the main lobe. These lobes represent directions in which the antenna also radiates power but with less intensity than the main lobe. Side lobes can be desirable or undesirable, depending on the application. In some cases, minimizing side lobes is crucial to reduce interference with other systems.
                    <br> <br>
                    <b>4. Minor Lobes: </b>
                    <br>
                    Minor lobes are additional lobes that appear in an antenna's radiation pattern alongside the main lobe. They represent directions where the antenna radiates power with lower intensity compared to the main lobe. These radiations should be minimized.
                    <br> <br>
                    <b>Front to Back Ratio:</b>
                    <br>
                    The front-to-back ratio (F/B ratio) is the ratio of the maximum power radiated in the main lobe (forward direction) to the power radiated in the backlobe (backward direction). A high F/B ratio indicates good directionality and less sensitivity to signals coming from the back.
                </div>
                <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-7-2"><b>7.2. Beamwidth:</b> <br>
                    The beamwidth is the angular separation between two points on the radiation pattern where the power drops to half its maximum value. Typically, these points are measured on either side of the main lobe's peak, where the radiation intensity is at its highest.
                    <br> <br>
                    Half-Power Beamwidth is the angular width of the main lobe in an antenna's radiation pattern, measured between two points where the power has dropped to half (-3 dB) of the maximum radiated power. In other words, it represents the angle over which the radiated power is at least half of the maximum power in the main lobe. A narrower HPBW indicates a more focused and directive antenna with concentrated power in a specific direction, while a wider HPBW indicates a more omnidirectional or broader coverage pattern.
                    <br> <br>
                    First-Null Beamwidth is the angular width between the first nulls (zeroes) on either side of the main lobe in an antenna's radiation pattern. It represents the angle over which the power in the radiation pattern drops to zero or very close to zero. The FNBW provides information about the antenna's ability to reject signals from certain directions. A smaller FNBW indicates better angular selectivity and more significant rejection of unwanted signals, while a larger FNBW implies less angular selectivity.
                </div>
                <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-7-3"><b>7.3. Directivity:</b> <br>
                    Antenna directivity is a measure of how well an antenna focuses its radiated energy in a specific direction. It quantifies the ability of an antenna to concentrate its power in a particular direction while reducing radiation in other directions. Directivity is an essential characteristic for directional antennas used in various applications, including long-range communication, point-to-point links, and radar systems.
                    <br> <br>
                    Directivity is typically expressed as a dimensionless quantity in decibels (dBi) or as a ratio. It is often compared to the performance of an ideal isotropic radiator, which radiates power equally in all directions. An isotropic radiator has a directivity of 0 dBi.
                </div>
                <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-7-4"><b>7.4. Bandwidth:</b> <br>
                    Antenna bandwidth refers to the range of frequencies over which the antenna can operate effectively to transmit or receive electromagnetic signals. It is an important performance parameter that characterizes an antenna's ability to handle a range of frequencies without significant degradation in performance.
                    <br> <br>
                    In practical terms, the antenna's bandwidth is usually defined by the frequency range over which certain key performance parameters meet specific criteria.
                    <br> <br>
                    For antennas used in communication systems, a broader bandwidth is generally preferred, as it allows the antenna to handle a wider range of frequencies and support various communication channels.
                </div>
                <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-7-5"><b>7.5. Polarization:</b> <br>
                    Antenna polarization refers to the orientation of the electric field vector in an electromagnetic wave radiated or received by an antenna. It is a critical characteristic that defines the spatial orientation of the electromagnetic wave as it propagates through space.
                    <br> <br>
                    The electric field vector of an electromagnetic wave can oscillate in any direction perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. The most common types of antenna polarization are:
                    <br> <br>
                    <b>1. Linear Polarization:</b>
                    <br>
                    In linear polarization, the electric field vector oscillates in a straight line, either horizontally (parallel to the Earth's surface) or vertically (perpendicular to the Earth's surface). Linear polarization can be either horizontal polarization (HP) or vertical polarization (VP), depending on the orientation of the electric field vector.
                    <br> <br>
                    <b>2. Circlar Polarization:</b>
                    <br>
                    In circular polarization, the electric field vector traces out a circular pattern as the wave propagates. Circular polarization can be right-hand circular polarization (RHCP) or left-hand circular polarization (LHCP), depending on the direction of rotation of the electric field vector.
                    <br> <br>
                    <b>3. Elliptical Polarization:</b>
                    <br>
                    Elliptical polarization is a combination of linear and circular polarization, resulting in an elliptical pattern for the electric field vector.
                </div>
                <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-7-6"><b>7.6. Gain:</b> <br>
                    Antenna gain is a measure of how well an antenna can direct or concentrate its radiated power in a specific direction compared to an ideal isotropic radiator. It quantifies the ability of an antenna to radiate more power in a particular direction, thus increasing its effective range in that direction.
                </div>
                <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-7-7"><b>7.7. Input Impedence:</b> <br>
                    Input impedance is a critical parameter that characterizes the electrical properties of an antenna or any other electronic device that interacts with a transmission line or circuit. It refers to the complex impedance presented at the input terminals of the device when it is connected to an external source or load.
                    <br> <br>
                    For an antenna, the input impedance varies with frequency, polarization, and other factors. It is essential for the antenna to be well-matched to the transmission line or receiver it is connected to. A good impedance match ensures efficient power transfer and minimizes signal reflections and losses.
                </div>
                <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-7-8"><b>7.8. Radiation Resistance:</b> <br>
                    Radiation resistance, also known as radiation impedance, is a crucial concept in antenna theory and design. It is the equivalent resistance that represents the power radiated as electromagnetic waves from an antenna when it is transmitting a signal. In other words, radiation resistance quantifies the fraction of the input power that an antenna effectively radiates into space.
                </div>
                <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-7-9"><b>7.9. Efficiency:</b> <br>
                    Antenna efficiency is a measure of how effectively an antenna converts the input power into radiated electromagnetic waves. It quantifies the fraction of the input power that is radiated as useful electromagnetic energy, and it is a crucial parameter for evaluating an antenna's performance.
                    <br> <br>
                    Antenna efficiency is expressed as a percentage and is calculated as:
                    <br> <br>
                    Efficiency (%) = (Radiation Resistance / Total Input Impedance) x 100
                    <br> <br>
                    Antenna efficiency takes into account various losses that occur within the antenna system. Some of the key factors that can impact antenna efficiency include Ohmic losses due to various resistances, dielectric losses and reflection losses.
                    <br> <br>
                    An ideal antenna would have an efficiency of 100%, meaning that all the input power is radiated as electromagnetic waves with no losses. However, real-world antennas always have some losses, which reduce their efficiency.
                </div>
                <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-7-10"><b>7.10. Effective Length:</b> <br>
                    The effective antenna length refers to the length of an antenna as perceived by the radio waves it transmits or receives. It is not necessarily the same as the physical length of the antenna itself. Instead, it is a concept used to describe the effective electrical length of the antenna, which influences its resonant frequency and radiation pattern.
                    <br> <br>
                    The effective length of linearly polarized antenna receiving a plane wave in a given direction is defined as the ratio of the magnitude of the open circuit voltage developed at the terminals of the antenna tothe magnitude of the electric-field strength in the direction of the antenna polarization.
                </div>
                <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-7-11"><b>7.11. EFfective Area:</b> <br>
                    Antenna effective area, also known as aperture area or capture area, is a critical parameter that quantifies the ability of an antenna to capture electromagnetic energy from incoming signals. It represents the area of the antenna's aperture that is effective in capturing or intercepting the incident radiation.
                    <br> <br>
                    The effective area is directly related to the antenna's gain and is often used to compare antennas in terms of their receiving capabilities. A larger effective area generally indicates a more efficient antenna for receiving signals.
                </div>
                <div class="sub-cBox" id="section-7-12"><b>7.12. Radiation Intensity:</b> <br>
                    Radiation intensity is a measure of the power density of electromagnetic radiation radiated by an antenna in a specific direction. It quantifies the amount of power transmitted by the antenna in a given direction per unit solid angle. Radiation intensity is an important parameter in antenna theory and is used to analyze and characterize the directional properties of antennas.
