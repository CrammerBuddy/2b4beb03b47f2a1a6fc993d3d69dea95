                    <b>Stations:</b>
                    <br>
                    Stations in an optical network serves as the source and destination of the information being transmitted and received. Stations are basically those devices that are used by the users of the network. For example, a computer or any other telecommunication device.
                    <br> <br>
                    <b>Trunk:</b>
                    <br>
                    A trunk is basically a transmission line i.e., optical fiber cable in order to transmit the optical signal. A network is composed of one or multiple trunks for signal transmission over large distance.
                    <br> <br>
                    <b>Node:</b>
                    <br>
                    Node is nothing but acts as a hub for multiple transmission lines inside the network. In case of a single transmission line, an optical network does not require nodes, as in this case stations at both the ends can be directly connected to the fiber cables.
                    <br> <br>
                    <b>Topology: </b>
                    <br>
                    When multiple fiber cables are employed in an optical network, then these are connected through nodes. But the way in which the multiple nodes are connected together denotes the topology of the network.
                    <br> <br>
                    <b>Router: </b>
                    <br>
                    A router is basically placed inside an optical network that provides a suitable path for signal transmission.

                    <br><br>
                    <b>Ring Topology:</b>
                    <br>
                    In a ring topology, nodes are connected in a closed path where each node is linked to its neighboring node. The transmitted light signals travel from one node to another. Optical couplers are used to facilitate signal coupling between nodes within the network.

                    <b>Mesh Topology:</b>
                    <br>
                    In a mesh topology, nodes are interconnected in an arbitrary manner, forming point-to-point connections. This configuration offers flexibility, allowing for dynamic signal routing based on the application. In case of a failure in one node, alternative paths can be used for signal transmission. In a mesh topology, the failed link or node is detected, and the signal traffic is redirected to an alternate link within the connection.

                <h1>FDDI</h1>
                <p>
                    FDDI stands for Fiber Distributed Data Interface. It is a high-speed, high-bandwidth network based on optical transmissions. It is most often used as a network backbone, for connecting high-end computers (mainframes, minicomputers, and peripherals), and for LANs connecting high-performance engineering, graphics, and other workstations that demand a rapid transfer of large amounts of data. It can transport data at a rate of 100 Megabits per second and can support up to 500 stations on a single network. FDDI was designed to run through fiber cables, transmitting light pulses to convey information between stations, but it can also run on copper using electrical signals. It is relatively expensive to implement, although the mixing of fiber-optic with copper cabling can hold down the cost.
                    <br><br>
                    FDDI is highly reliable because FDDI networks consist of two counter-rotating rings. A secondary ring provides an alternate data path in the event a fault occurring on the primary ring. FDDI stations incorporate this secondary ring into the data path to route traffic around the fault. FDDI based on a ring topology with token passing. It is an advanced technology, in the form of the token ring over optical fiber. FDDI developed for two primary reasons: to support and help extend the capabilities of older LANs, such as Ethernet and Token Ring, and to provide a reliable infrastructure for businesses, moving even mission-critical applications to networks.
                    <br><br>
                    Although FDDI is not really a WAN technology (its ring are limited to a maximum length of 100 kilometers or 62 miles), the ground it can cover does make it suitable for use as a backbone, connecting a number of smaller LANs, and it can provide the core of a network as extensive as a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN). In that sense, FDDI is more than LAN but less than WAN. Also, because FDDI transfers information extremely quickly (l00 Mbps), it is often used to connect high-end devices such as mainframes, minicomputers, and peripherals, or to connect high-performance devices within a LAN. Engineering or video or graphics workstations, for instance, benefit from FODI because they need much bandwidth, to transfer large amounts of data at satisfactorily high steeds. FDDI can easily be incorporated into existing networks because it works even with other network topologies (due to the LLC protocol that is also used by Ethernet and Token Ring).

                <h1>Access</h1>
                <p>
                    An optical access network is a type of telecommunications network that utilizes optical fiber technology to provide high-speed connectivity and services to end-users. It is designed to deliver data, voice, and video services from the service provider's network to individual homes, businesses, or institutions.
                    <br><br>
                    Optical access network (OAN) refers to the use of optical fiber as the main transmission medium to realize the information transmission function of the access network. It is connected to the service node through an optical line terminal (OLT) and connected to the user through an optical network unit (ONU). The optical access network includes remote devices – optical network units and central office devices – optical line terminals that are connected by transmission devices.
                    <br><br>
                    The role of the OLT is to provide an interface between the access network and the local switch, and communicate with the optical network unit of the client through optical transmission. It completely separates the switching function of the switch from user access. The optical line terminal provides maintenance and monitoring for itself and the user. It can be placed directly at the exchange or with the local switch at the remote end.
                    <br><br>
                    The role of the ONU is to provide a user-side interface to the access network. It can be connected to a variety of user terminals, with photoelectric conversion and corresponding maintenance and monitoring functions. The main function of the ONU is to terminate the fiber from the OLT, process the optical signal and provide business interfaces for multiple small businesses, business users and residential users. The network side of the ONU is an optical interface, and the user end is an electrical interface. Therefore, the ONU has optical/electrical and electrical/optical conversion functions. It also has the digital/analog and analog/digital conversion functions of the dialogue. The ONU is usually placed closer to the user and has a great deal of flexibility.
